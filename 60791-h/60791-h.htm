<h2><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>THE WAR
WITH RUSSIA.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Amid</span> the din of arms and the fierce
contest of battle, the less harmful, but, perhaps, not the less
potent war of opinion, the clash of controversy, the
dissemination of &ldquo;views,&rdquo; are as busy at their work
as in the piping times of peace.&nbsp; As might have been
anticipated, the terrible struggle in which we are engaged has
absorbed every other feeling; and whether men agree or disagree
respecting the cause, the necessity, and the justness of the war,
all are zealous and earnest in advocacy or opposition.&nbsp; A
vast majority of the nation believe in the justness of
England&rsquo;s position&mdash;believe that she exhausted every
means, and even went beyond the strict line of national respect,
in seeking to stay the hand of him who, in sanctimonious phrase,
was ever ringing changes on the theme of peace, and yet proved
himself so eager to &ldquo;cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of
war&rdquo;&mdash;believe that no other course was open to
her&mdash;believe that if she wished to preserve her own
dearly-won liberties, she must stoutly oppose any further
encroachments on the rights and liberties of Turkey.&nbsp; A vast
majority of the nation were, and still are, firmly convinced of
this, and have most emphatically declared the firmness of that
conviction by the enthusiasm of their support and the wonderful
liberality of their purses.&nbsp; Yet, notwithstanding the
clearness with which our course was marked out for
us&mdash;notwithstanding the steady and continuous aggression of
Russia, now by secret fraud and now by open force, since the time
of Peter I. to the present day&mdash;there is a party in England,
and there are a number of Englishmen, who, taking pre-conceived
views to their study of the question, profess to find in the Blue
Books&mdash;in the documents issued by the Governments of the
great nations, England, France, Turkey, and
Russia&mdash;sufficient reason to condemn the policy which
England has adopted, and to declare the war dishonourable,
unjust, and disgraceful.&nbsp; Among the party taking this view
are men of wealth and influence, and no pains or expense is
spared in propagating their opinions.&nbsp; Lecturers are busy
going from town to town disseminating partial and <i>ex parte</i>
statements of the cause of the war; and letters and speeches, to
which are added carefully collected extracts from the Blue Books,
are printed and gratuitously distributed by thousands in order to
indoctrinate the people with falsely-called peace
principles.&nbsp; The purpose of the present tract is to examine
the pretensions of this party, to test its statements, to
complete the quotations which have been so partially made, and by
presenting a <i>full</i> <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>statement of facts, to enable the
people to judge for themselves of the worth of that advocacy and
the justice of that cause which has to resort to such expedients
for its support and defence.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bright</span>, in his Letter to Mr.
<span class="smcap">Absalom Watkin</span>, says that &ldquo;we
are not only at war with Russia, but with all the Christian
population of the Turkish Empire;&rdquo; and Mr. <span
class="smcap">George Thompson</span>, in his Lecture on the War,
corroborated this statement by the curiously bold assertion, that
the &ldquo;Greek Christians, who formed the mass of the
population of Turkey in Europe, were of a common faith, common
hope, and acknowledge a common headship with those of
Russia.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, what are the facts?&nbsp; The Greek
Church in Turkey considers the Russian Greek Church as
schismatical and heretical, and refuse, and have ever refused, to
acknowledge the Patriarchship of the Emperor of Russia.&nbsp; Of
the 11,000,000 members of the Greek Church who are the subjects
of the Sultan, there are in the Principalities of Moldavia and
Wallachia about 4,000,000; these, with the exception of some
50,000 Hungarian Catholics, are of the Greek, but not of the
Russo-Greek, Church.&nbsp; Servia has also 1,000,000 of the same
persuasion, and equally averse to the Russian Czar-Patriarch;
Servia has also for a long time past been striving to shake off
the influence of Russia, and to unite herself more closely with
her rightful ruler, the Sultan.&nbsp; Besides these, there are
2,400,000 Eutychian Armenians, of which 40,000 belong to the
Latin Church, and also more than 1,000,000 are Roman Catholics
and United Greeks.&nbsp; <i>None of these recognise the
Patriarchship of the Emperor of Russia</i>.</p>
<p>In order that the feeling of the Greek Church in Turkey
respecting this matter may be fully understood, I quote the
following passage from an address delivered by the Archimandrate
Suagoaud to the Roumains, (Moldo-Wallachians) in Paris, so late
as January, 1853.&nbsp; The occasion was this: the Roumains had
asked permission from the French Government to build a chapel in
Paris, and the application was received with the very pertinent
question, (supposing them to be of the same Church as the Peace
Society do,) &ldquo;Why do you not worship in the Russian Chapel
already erected in Paris?&rdquo;&nbsp; Here is the answer:
&ldquo;When we expressed a desire to found a Chapel of our own
rite, we were told that a Russian Chapel already existed in
Paris, and we were asked why the Roumains do not frequent
it.&nbsp; What! Roumains to frequent a Russian place of
worship!&nbsp; Is it then forgotten that they can never enter its
walls, and that the Wallachians who die in Paris, forbid, at
their very last hour, that their bodies should be borne to a
Muscovite Chapel, and declare that the presence of a Russian
priest would be an insult to their tomb.&nbsp; Whence comes this
irreconcilable hatred?&nbsp; That hatred is perpetuated by the
difference of language.&nbsp; The Russian tongue is Sclavonic;
ours is Latin.&nbsp; Is there, in fact, a single Roumain who
understands the language of the Muscovite?&nbsp; That hatred is
just; for is not Russia our mortal enemy?&nbsp; Has she not
closed up our schools and debarred us from all instruction, in
order to sink our people into the depths of barbarism, and to
reduce them the more easily to servitude?&nbsp; On that hatred I
pronounce a blessing; for the Russian Church is a schism the
Roumains reject; because the Russian Church has separated from
the great Eastern Church; because the Russian Church does not
recognise as its head the Patriarch of Constantinople; because it
does not receive the Holy Unction of Byzantium; because it has
constituted itself into a Synod of which the Czar is the <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>despot; and
because that Synod, in obedience to his orders, has changed its
worship, has fabricated an unction which it terms holy, has
suppressed or changed the fast days and the Lents as established
by our bishops; because it has canonised Sclavonians who are
apocryphal saints, such as Vladimir, Olgo, and so many others
whose names are unknown to us; because the rite of Confession,
which was instituted to ameliorate and save the penitent, has
become, by the servility of the Muscovite clergy, an instrument
for spies for the benefit of the Czar; in fine, because the Synod
has violated the law, and that its reforms are arbitrary, and are
made to further the objects of despotism.&nbsp; These acts of
impiety being so notorious, and these truths so known, who shall
now maintain that the Russian Church is not schismatic?&nbsp; Our
Councils reject it, our canons forbid us to recognise it, our
Church disowns it; and all who hold to the faith and whom she
recognises for her children, are bound to respect her decision,
and to consider the Russian rite a schismatic rite.&nbsp; Such
are the motives which prevent the Roumains from attending the
Russian Chapel in Paris.&rdquo;&mdash;(Quoted in
<i>Blackwood&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, March, 1853.)</p>
<p>But even if they were of the same faith, the same hope, and
acknowledged the same common headship as the Russian Greek
Church, upon what right does Russia found her protectorate over
these subjects of the Ottoman empire?&nbsp; The following are the
three articles in the treaty of Kainardji which relate to the
Turkish Greek subjects:&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">&ldquo;Article VII.&mdash;<i>The Porte</i>
promises to protect the Christian religion and its churches; and
the Ministers of Russia shall be allowed to make representations
in favour of the new church of which mention is made in the 14th
article.</p>
<p class="gutindent">&ldquo;Article VIII.&mdash;The subjects of
the Russian empire shall be permitted to visit the city of
Jerusalem and the Holy Places; and no duty or contribution shall
be exacted from them either at Jerusalem or elsewhere.</p>
<p class="gutindent">&ldquo;Article XIV.&mdash;The Court of
Russia is permitted, besides the chapel built in the
Minister&rsquo;s house, to build in the quarter of Galata, in the
street named Bey Oglou, a public church of the Greek rite, which
shall always be under the protection of the Russian Minister, and
secure from all vexation and exaction.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Blue
Book</i>, vol. i., p. 51.)</p>
<p>Now this treaty states, as plainly as words can do, that
<i>the Porte</i> is to protect the Christian religion and its
churches, and that the protection of Russia is limited to the
chapel to be built in the quarter of Galata, in the street named
Bey Oglou: yet upon this treaty Russia claims her right to
interfere, to occupy the Principalities for the purpose of
obtaining material guarantees; and the Peace Society agrees to
her claim and palliates, where it cannot justify, her acts.</p>
<p>Again, Mr. <span class="smcap">Bright</span> writes, &ldquo;I
have said nothing of the fact that all these troubles have sprung
out of the demands made by France upon the Turkish Government,
and urged in language more insulting than any which has been
shown to have been used by Prince
Menschikoff.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Letter</i>, pp. 13&ndash;14.)&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Mr. Thompson</span>, who appears to have made
this letter the text for his various lucubrations, reiterates the
same charge.&nbsp; Let us carefully examine this part of the
subject.&nbsp; The claim of the French rests upon the treaty of
1740, which &ldquo;vindicates the right of the Latins to an
exclusive occupation of all the sanctuaries which they possessed
at that time.&nbsp; The conferences lately opened here, have
resulted in a clear establishment of that right as applied to the
holy buildings&mdash;ten, I believe, <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>in number&mdash;most of which are now
possessed jointly by the two communions, and some exclusively by
the Greeks.&nbsp; M. de <span class="smcap">Lavalette</span>,
<i>instead of pushing his right to an extreme</i>, <i>took upon
himself the responsibility of declaring his readiness to extend
the principles of joint possession to the whole number</i>. * *
He (M. de <span class="smcap">Lavalette</span>) has acted with
moderation throughout; he has been careful not to commit his
Government&mdash;he has made no written communication except his
opening note and such documents as were necessary for
establishing the joint commission of enquiry&mdash;and he is
anxious to act with moderation to the last; but at the same time
he thinks it impossible to submit with honour to the present plan
of proceeding; his Government, having embarked in the question,
cannot, with any degree of credit or consistency, stop short
under the dictation of Russia; the national party in France, the
Catholic party there and elsewhere, will press for the full
assertion of right under treaty&mdash;and, as for himself, he
will retire rather than be made the instrument, as he conceives
he would be, in the supposed case of his country&rsquo;s
humiliation; nay more, if it depended upon him, he would not
hesitate to make use of the great naval force now possessed by
France in the Mediterranean, and by blockading the Dardanelles,
bring the question in debate forthwith to a satisfactory
issue.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Sir Stratford Canning to Viscount
Palmerston</i>, <i>Nov.</i> 4, 1851; <i>Blue Book</i>, vol. i.,
p. 19.)</p>
<p>Those demands were supported by the plenipotentiaries of all
the Catholic Powers.&nbsp; England looked on without any personal
interest in the question itself; the Porte was anxious and
unsettled, for Russia, through M. de <span
class="smcap">Titoff</span>, was loud in her demands for the
<i>status quo</i>, and threatened to leave Constantinople if it
were disturbed.&nbsp; But this <i>status quo</i> meant
Russia&rsquo;s interpretation of it&mdash;meant, Russia being
fully accepted as the Protector of the Greeks, which, as we saw,
she strongly claimed from the Hainardji Treaty; the <i>status
quo</i> which France desired was simply the restoration of rights
which had been allowed to fall in abeyance by the Latins, and
had, in some measure, been acquired by the Greeks.</p>
<p>I do not state here how very trifling to us appear the causes
which led to those demands, because we cannot appreciate all this
pother being made about the possession of a key or two, the
building of a cupola, and the putting up of a silver star; but to
the Latins such questions are of great importance; and
politically they served as indices to measure the influence which
the French and Russians exercised in the East.&nbsp; I pass on to
the official documents narrating the development of this
quarrel.&nbsp; Colonel <span class="smcap">Rose</span>, writing
to the Earl of <span class="smcap">Malmesbury</span>, Nov. 20,
1852, says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A graver cause of difference than the great
door of the Church of Bethlehem has appeared, and taken
precedence of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Porte, under the influence of French and Russian
menaces, conceded to the French Embassy the note of the 9th
February, and the Firman of the Mi-F&eacute;vri&egrave;r to the
Greeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Russian Government considers the Firman the Charter
of Rights of the Greek Church.&nbsp; The President and M. de
<span class="smcap">Lavalette</span> consider it an affront to
France, because it describes her claims, grounded on the Treaty
of 1740, as &ldquo;haksig,&rdquo; unjust, and establishes a
<i>status quo</i> which wholly invalidates that Treaty.&nbsp; M.
de <span class="smcap">Lavalette</span> tells me that the Porte
promised to M. <span class="smcap">Sabatier</span> that it should
not be read at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M. <span class="smcap">D&rsquo;Ozeroff</span> tells the
Porte that the Firman must be read at Jerusalem; he declares that
if it be not read, according to usage, in the <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Medgliss at
Jerusalem, before the Pasha, Cadi, Members of the Council,
Patriarchs of the different sects, it will be valueless and a
dead letter, and that, consequently, faith will have been broken
with Russia.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Blue Book</i>, vol. i., p. 46.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This irritable state of things assumed a more amicable aspect
by December 4, 1852: writing at that date, Colonel <span
class="smcap">Rose</span> says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;M. de <span class="smcap">Lavalette</span>
now says that nothing can be more pleasant and amiable (plus doux
et plus aimable) than he is with the Porte.&nbsp; I humbly and
respectfully demand my right.&nbsp; (Je demande humblement et
respecteusement mon droit).&nbsp; M. d&rsquo;<span
class="smcap">Ozeroff</span> also says, that although he admitted
that last year there had been a declaration that the Russian
Legation would, under certain circumstances, leave
Constantinople, yet, that he could not bring to his recollection
having talked of the Legation leaving it on account of present
causes of differences with the Porte.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Blue
Book</i>, vol. i., pp. 49&ndash;50.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the question of the Holy Places was thus winding its
weary way along, the Emperor of Russia was ordering troops to the
frontiers of the Danubian Provinces.&nbsp; On the 4th of January,
1853, Sir G. H. <span class="smcap">Seymour</span> writes to Lord
<span class="smcap">John Russell</span>, that &ldquo;orders have
been dispatched to the 5th corps d&rsquo;arm&eacute;e to advance
to the frontiers of the Danubian Provinces, <i>without waiting
for their reserves</i>; and the 4th corps, under the command of
General Count <span class="smcap">Dannenberg</span>, and now
stationed in Volhynia, will be ordered to hold itself in
readiness to march if necessary.&nbsp; Each of these corps
consists of twenty-four regiments, and, as your Lordship is
aware, each Russian regiment is composed of three battalions
(each of about 1000 men), of which one battalion forms the
reserve.&nbsp; General <span class="smcap">Luder&rsquo;s</span>
corps d&rsquo;arm&eacute;e accordingly, being now 48,000 strong,
will receive a reinforcement of 24,000 men soon after its arrival
at its destination, and supposing the 4th corps to follow, the
whole force will amount at least, according to official returns,
to 144,000 men.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Blue Book</i>, vol. i., p.
56)</p>
<p>January 28, 1853, Colonel <span class="smcap">Rose</span>
says, &ldquo;Both the French and Russian Representatives exhibit
now most laudable moderation in the matter of the Holy
Places.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Blue Book</i>, vol. i., p. 79.)</p>
<p>And now new events occur in this strange drama.&nbsp; The
three great Powers&mdash;England, France, and Russia&mdash;remove
their ambassadors and appoint new ones.&nbsp; England sent
Viscount <span class="smcap">Stratford de Redcliffe</span>,
France, M. de la <span class="smcap">Cour</span>, and Russia, the
notorious Prince <span class="smcap">Menchikoff</span>.&nbsp; The
first act of the Russian officer was an insult to the
Porte&mdash;an insult committed with intention, and at once
indicating both the character of the mission and of the man
appointed to execute it.&nbsp; Colonel <span
class="smcap">Rose</span> writes to Lord <span class="smcap">John
Russell</span>, March 3, 1853, &ldquo;A painful sensation was
caused here by the following incident, which occurred
yesterday:&mdash;Prince <span class="smcap">Menchikoff</span>
paid his official visit to the Grand Vizier, at the Porte, but
purposely omitted to pay it to <span class="smcap">Fuad
Effendi</span>, who was ready to receive
him.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Blue Book</i>, vol. i., p. 85.)</p>
<p>In another despatch, dated March 7, 1853, are these
passages:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Circumstances connected with the mission of
Prince <span class="smcap">Menchikoff</span> have gradually come
to light, and cause grave apprehension for the independence, if
not the destiny, of Turkey. * * Unfortunately, Prince <span
class="smcap">Menchikoff&rsquo;s</span> first public act evinced
<i>entire disregard</i>, <i>on his part</i>, <i>of the
Sultan&rsquo;s dignity and rights</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>combined
with the hostile attitude of </i><a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span><i>Russia</i>, <i>created the
impression that coercion</i>, <i>rather than conciliatory
negotiation</i>, <i>would distinguish his Excellency&rsquo;s
mission</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, further on, speaking of the affront offered to <span
class="smcap">Fuad Effendi</span>, he says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The affront was the more galling, because
great preparations had been made for the purpose of receiving the
Russian Ambassador with marked honours, and a great concourse of
people, particularly Greeks, had assembled for the purpose of
witnessing the ceremony.&nbsp; The incident made a great and most
painful sensation.&nbsp; The Grand Vizier expressed to me his
indignation at the premeditated affront which had been offered to
his Sovereign, and the Sultan&rsquo;s irritation was
excessive.&nbsp; M. <span class="smcap">Benedetti</span> and
myself at once saw all the bearing and intention of the
affront.&nbsp; Prince <span class="smcap">Menchikoff</span>
<i>wished</i>, <i>at his first start</i>, <i>to create an
intimidating or commanding influence</i>&mdash;<i>to show that
any man</i>, <i>even a Cabinet Minister</i>, <i>who had offended
Russia</i>, <i>would be humiliated and punished</i>, <i>even in
the midst of the Sultan&rsquo;s Court</i>, <i>and without
previous communication to His Majesty</i>.&nbsp; <i>Prince
Menchikoff wished to take the cleverest man out of the
Ministry</i>, <i>humiliate it</i>, <i>upset it</i>, <i>and
establish in its place a Ministry favourable to his
views</i>.&nbsp; <i>If this man&oelig;uvre had succeeded</i>,
<i>a second treaty</i>, <i>like that of Unkier Skelessi</i>,
<i>or something worse</i>, <i>would probably have been the
result</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Blue Book</i>, vol. i., pp.
86&ndash;7).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such was the commencement of the mission of that man whose
moderation Englishmen have been found prejudiced enough to
praise.&nbsp; Nor can there be a doubt respecting the intention
of Russia.&nbsp; While her Ambassador was insulting the Porte
before the eyes of the assembled people, active preparations were
being made to concentrate troops on the Danubian Provinces.&nbsp;
Our Vice-Consul, <span class="smcap">Charles Cunningham</span>,
writing from Galatz, February 25, 1853, nearly two months before
Prince <span class="smcap">Menchikoff</span> arrived at
Constantinople, says, &ldquo;For some months past, there have
been rumours that a large Russian force has been collected in
Bessarabia, and even that these Provinces were to be
occupied.&nbsp; From the information I have obtained, I consider
it certain that the inhabitants of Bessarabia, in the districts
around Ismail and Reni, have orders to prepare quarters for
60,000 troops.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Blue Book</i>, vol. i., p.
90).&nbsp; The French Consul at Jassy confirms this
statement.&nbsp; He says: &ldquo;All persons and letters coming
from Bessarabia concur in saying that very serious preparations
for war are there making&mdash;(s&rsquo; accordent &agrave; dire
qu&rsquo;il s&rsquo;y fait ce tr&egrave;s-s&eacute;rieux
preparatifs de guerre).&nbsp; Vast supplies of biscuit are
already prepared, and the troops have received orders to hold
themselves in readiness to march at the first
signal.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Blue Book</i>, vol. i., p. 92.)&nbsp;
Yet amidst all this warlike preparation Russia still continued to
talk of her &ldquo;pacific intentions&rdquo;&mdash;of her
&ldquo;desire to preserve the independence and integrity of the
Ottoman empire&rdquo;&mdash;of her &ldquo;deep respect and
friendly feelings towards His Majesty the Sultan.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She manifested the truth of her words by sending an ambassador to
insult, and concentrating troops to overawe, her dear friend, the
Sultan, whose rights, more than her own, she hypocritically
declared to be the great purpose at which she aimed.</p>
<p>This concentration of troops on the frontier, connected with
the conduct of Prince <span class="smcap">Menchikoff</span> at
the Capital, naturally aroused the suspicion and called for the
watchfulness of the other Powers.&nbsp; As Sir G. H. <span
class="smcap">Seymour</span> said to the Russian Chancellor,
&ldquo;if the presence of a Russian army on the borders of the
Principalities is likely to arouse the apprehension of foreign
Governments, what effects is it calculated to produce upon the <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>Porte?&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Blue Book</i>, vol. i., p.
58.)&nbsp; That effect was well calculated by Russia.&nbsp; She
hoped to produce fear, disaffection, disturbance and bloodshed,
in the midst of which she might come in as a protector, carry on
her old and well-learnt tactics, and end in appropriating to her
own colossal territories&mdash;the greater part acquired by fraud
or war.&nbsp; It was her old plan.&nbsp; The world has been the
almost indifferent spectator of her custom for more than sixty
years.&nbsp; She now began in Turkey, as she began in Poland, in
Finland, in Courland, in Georgia, in Bessarabia, and in every
other country which her insatiable greed and ambition
desired.&nbsp; Her process &ldquo;has almost been reduced to a
regular formula.&nbsp; It invariably commences with
disorganization, by means of corruption and secret agency, pushed
to the extent of disorder and civil contention.&nbsp; Next in
order comes military occupation, to restore tranquility; and
<i>in every instance the result has been</i> <span
class="smcap">Protection</span>, <i>followed by</i> <span
class="smcap">Incorporation</span>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a>&nbsp; But I anticipate.</p>
<p>The plot thickens as it proceeds.&nbsp; From a communication
of M. <span class="smcap">Pisani&rsquo;s</span> to Colonel <span
class="smcap">Rose</span>, March 19, 1853, it appears that he
&ldquo;got information from good authority that this moderate
behaviour on the part of the Russian Ambassador is calculated to
induce the Porte to assent to the conclusion of a <i>secret
compact</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Blue Book</i>, vol. i., p.
107.)&nbsp; Again, Colonel <span class="smcap">Rose</span> says,
March 25, 1853, &ldquo;The Grand Vizier informs me, also, that,
in the projected treaty, there is a clause which could be
interpreted into protection, by Russia, of the Turkish Greek
Church.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Blue Book</i>, vol. i., pp.
107&ndash;8.)&nbsp; Yet we are told by the Peace Party that
Russia asked for and demanded nothing but the preservation of the
<i>status quo</i>; and, as we saw by the articles of the Treaty
of Kainardji, such protection formed no part of the <i>status
quo</i>.</p>
<p>During all these strange proceedings, and amid all these cross
purposes, Prince <span class="smcap">Menchikoff</span>, true to
his Russian policy, was silent as to the main object of his
mission.&nbsp; He even &ldquo;tried to exact a promise from <span
class="smcap">Rifaat Pasha</span>, <i>before he makes known to
him the nature of his mission and of his demands</i>, <i>that the
Porte shall make a formal promise that she will not reveal them
to the British or French Representatives</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Rifaat Pasha</span> declined, and Prince <span
class="smcap">Menchikoff</span> declared that if the object of
his mission was not promptly settled, <i>he must leave
Constantinople</i>; but he modified this declaration by saying
that he did not mean thereby to imply that his retirement would
be the signal for war.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Blue Book</i>, vol. i.,
p. 109.)</p>
<p>In order that no mistake may be made respecting the object of
Prince <span class="smcap">Menchikoff&rsquo;s</span> mission, I
quote from the note of M. <span class="smcap">Doria</span> to
Colonel <span class="smcap">Rose</span>, dated April 1, 1853, the
following passage:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Prince <span
class="smcap">Menchikoff</span> had verbally expressed the
Emperor&rsquo;s wish to enter into a secret treaty with Turkey,
<i>putting a fleet and</i> 400,000 <i>men at her disposal</i>,
<i>if she ever needed aid against any Western Power
whatever</i>.&nbsp; That Russia further secretly demanded an
addition to the treaty of Kainardji, whereby the Greek Church
should be placed <i>entirely under Russian protection</i>,
<i>without reference to Turkey</i>, which was to be the
equivalent for the proffered aid above
mentioned.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Blue Book</i>, vol. i., p. 112.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While these interferences with the rights of the Ottoman Porte
were systematically pursued at Constantinople, Russia was busily
employed in the same insidious course in Servia.&nbsp; Lord <span
class="smcap">Clarendon</span> informs Lord <span
class="smcap">Stratford de Redcliffe</span>, <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>April 18,
1853, that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;the Prince of Servia has dismissed M. <span
class="smcap">Garaschanin</span> from his service, on the
<i>peremptory demand of Prince Menchikoff</i>, and that the
Russian Consul at Belgrade has subsequently, in threatening
terms, required the removal of several other official
persons.&nbsp; This interference with the internal government of
the Province has excited much discontent among the Servian
people; and your Excellency is instructed to state to Prince
<span class="smcap">Menchikoff</span>, that in the opinion of Her
Majesty&rsquo;s Government, a perseverance in this course will be
productive of mischievous results.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Blue
Book</i>, vol. i., p. 122.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can any sane man doubt the object of all this interference,
the purpose of all these threatenings, and the aim of all this
diplomatic bullying and intrigue?&nbsp; The original causes
assigned by Russia for such interference had been removed; and,
as Colonel <span class="smcap">Rose</span> told Prince <span
class="smcap">Menchikoff</span>, &ldquo;the recall of M. de <span
class="smcap">Lavalette</span> and the retirement of <span
class="smcap">Fuad Effendi</span> must be considered a
satisfactory reparation; that Montenegro had been evacuated;
that, in short, none of the causes alleged by Russia as causes
for a hostile attitude existed any longer.&rdquo;&mdash;(vol. i.,
p. 122.)</p>
<p>By May 6, 1853, the subject of the Holy Places was settled,
both to the satisfaction of M. de la <span
class="smcap">Cour</span> and Prince <span
class="smcap">Menchikoff</span>; when, having received fresh
instructions from Russia, Prince <span
class="smcap">Menchikoff</span> sent a decisive communication to
the Porte; concerning which Sir <span class="smcap">Stratford de
Redcliffe</span> says,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;it must appear the more alarming to the
Porte, as it has followed close upon his Excellency&rsquo;s
receipt of the <i>firmans and official note which but yesterday
terminated with his assent the question of the Holy
Places</i>.&nbsp; That communication is, moreover, peremptory in
fixing a very brief delay for the Porte&rsquo;s definitive reply;
and it comprises the Russian <i>note verbale</i> of the 19th
ultimo in its more formal expression of Russia&rsquo;s
demands.&nbsp; It insists in certain unexplained additions to the
settlement of the Jerusalem question, but little palatable to
France; and although in some degree moderated in comparison with
its original extent, requires, under the name of
&lsquo;guarantee,&rsquo; a concession, the dangerous character of
which will not escape your Lordship&rsquo;s
observation.&rdquo;&mdash;(Vol. i., p. 164.)&nbsp; Prince <span
class="smcap">Menchikoff&rsquo;s</span> words are, &ldquo;the
Ambassador begs his Excellency, <span class="smcap">Rifaat
Pasha</span>, to be good enough to let him have that answer by
Tuesday next, May 10.&nbsp; He cannot consider a longer delay in
any other light than as a want of respect towards his Government,
<i>which would</i> impose upon him the most painful
duty.&rdquo;&mdash;(Vol. i., p. 167.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have now reached a point of the present discussion at which
we may pause, and sum up the result.&nbsp; It appears from the
passages quoted from the various despatches of different
ambassadors, that though the French were the first introducers of
the question of the Holy Places, the quarrel, so far as they were
concerned, was now satisfactorily and amicably settled.&nbsp;
That they might have been to blame in the first instance,
scarcely affects the after development of the plans and projects
of Russia.&nbsp; M. de la <span class="smcap">Cour</span> was
satisfied, Prince <span class="smcap">Menchikoff</span> was, or
said he was, satisfied, the French Government authorised M. de la
<span class="smcap">Cour</span> &ldquo;to state that, with regard
to the question of the Holy Places,&rdquo; she was
&ldquo;satisfied.&nbsp; The present arrangement is the
arrangement made by M. de <span class="smcap">Lavalette</span>,
and France has consequently nothing to say against it.&nbsp; M.
de la <span class="smcap">Cour</span> is enjoined neither to
protest nor to make reserves.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Blue Book</i>,
vol. i, p. 175.)&nbsp; Yet this very moment of apparently
amicable arrangement is chosen by Russia to make other claims,
and to demand other privileges; then it was that Russia sent in
her <i>ultimatum</i>, <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>and sought to exercise the power of a
virtual sovereign over 11,000,000 of Turkish subjects, the vast
majority of whom dread nothing more than the exercise of such
authority, and who have shown, during the present contest, how
earnest they are in repelling the assumptions of the Emperor of
Russia.&nbsp; In Servia &ldquo;the great majority are patriotic
and desirous to exclude all extraneous intervention in their
affairs.&nbsp; They are content with their present position and
connexion with Turkey, which strengthens without annoying
them.&rdquo; <a name="citation11a"></a><a href="#footnote11a"
class="citation">[11a]</a>&nbsp; So it is with the other
Provinces over which Russia seeks to spread the terrible power of
her protection.&nbsp; Her protection is degradation, debasement,
and oppression.&nbsp; She has no scruples, for she worships a
policy.&nbsp; Whatever may help to develope that policy, be it
lying, intrigue, rebellion, spoliation, violation of Treaties, or
even murder and assassination, are resorted to.&nbsp; Nothing
intimidates her&mdash;nothing turns her aside.&nbsp; Rebuffed
now, she bides her time, and then makes another attempt, to be
succeeded by another, and another, and another, if necessary for
the accomplishment of her object.&nbsp; She talks of her good
faith at the same moment she is violating some solemnly-sworn
contract; she invokes the person and aid of Almighty God in all
her undertakings, though of the blackest and basest kind.&nbsp;
It has been well said that the &ldquo;kind of faith with which
she has acted is shown in the revolts she has instigated and
sustained in so many Turkish Provinces while she was at peace
with the Sultan and professing the warmest friendship.&nbsp; The
<i>good faith</i> of Russia is that which she exhibits in not
less than twenty-one schools of Bulgaria, where the Russians from
Kiew&mdash;the Mecca of the Muscovites&mdash;teach the children
who are all Turkish subjects, hatred of the Sultan as a part of
their religious instruction, and submission to the Czar as
necessary to their eternal salvation.&rdquo; <a
name="citation11b"></a><a href="#footnote11b"
class="citation">[11b]</a>&nbsp; Such is her
protection&mdash;such has it ever been; and by this insidious
conduct she is every year adding or preparing for future
additions to her ill-gotten possessions.&nbsp; But we are told
that &ldquo;the seat of war is 3,000 miles away from us.&nbsp; We
had not been attacked&mdash;not even insulted in any way;&rdquo;
<a name="citation11c"></a><a href="#footnote11c"
class="citation">[11c]</a> and therefore we ought to have had
nothing to do with the quarrel.&nbsp; No matter that existing
Treaties between ourselves and Turkey declare that we ought to
interfere; no matter that the future safety and honour of
Europe&mdash;probably of England herself&mdash;depended upon the
course we took in this question; no matter that right, justice,
and truth were on the side of Turkey; and wrong, insolence, and
unwarrantable aggression on the part of Russia; &ldquo;the seat
of war is 3,000 miles away from us&rdquo; and&mdash;we had
nothing to do with the quarrel.&nbsp; Happily the Government and
the people took a different view of the subject, and opposed the
great enemy.</p>
<p>Prince <span class="smcap">Menchikoff</span> left
Constantinople May 23rd, 1853.&nbsp; Mr. <span
class="smcap">Bright</span> has the following curious passage:
&ldquo;But for the English Minister at Constantinople and the
Cabinet at home, the dispute would have settled itself, and the
last note of Prince <span class="smcap">Menchikoff</span> would
have been accepted; and no human being can point out any material
difference between that note and the Vienna note afterwards
agreed upon and recommended by the Governments of England,
France, Austria, and Prussia.&nbsp; But our Government would not
allow the dispute to be settled.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would be
difficult to select any passage in the whole range of English
literature, of a similar <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>length, containing so many sophisms
as this.&nbsp; The note of Prince <span
class="smcap">Menchikoff</span> was so identical with the Vienna
note, that the Porte rejected both.&nbsp; And instead of the
English Ambassador preventing the amicable arrangement of the
question, he, acting under instructions from home, exerted every
means, short of cowardice and dishonour, to preserve the
peace.&nbsp; Passage upon passage could be selected from the Blue
Book, from despatches of Lord <span
class="smcap">Palmerston</span>, of the Earl of <span
class="smcap">Malmesbury</span>, of Lord <span class="smcap">John
Russell</span>, of the Earl of <span
class="smcap">Clarendon</span>, from the letters of Colonel <span
class="smcap">Rose</span> and Lord <span
class="smcap">Stratford</span> de <span
class="smcap">Redcliffe</span>, illustrative of this statement;
and, because the Sultan was advised not to accede to a demand
which would have destroyed his authority over 11,000,000 of his
subjects, England is charged with not allowing the dispute to be
settled; and because the Vienna note only reiterated <span
class="smcap">Menchikoff&rsquo;s</span> <i>ultimatum</i>, this
attempt to produce peace met the same fate as the others; still
it is England that prevented the settlement of the dispute.&nbsp;
For we are told that &ldquo;Prince <span
class="smcap">Menchikoff</span>, in his note dated the 21st of
May, which has caused a profound impression throughout Europe,
has proclaimed that religious objects alone have not been aimed
at by him.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Blue Book</i>, vol. i., p.
268.)&nbsp; Russia now pursued her usual course.&nbsp; She issued
a Manifesto, June 26, 1853;&mdash;a copy of this Manifesto was
published in the &ldquo;St. Petersburgh Journal,&rdquo;&mdash;and
this Manifesto differed essentially from the Manifesto issued to
the Russian people.&nbsp; &ldquo;Considerable sensation,&rdquo;
says Sir G. H. <span class="smcap">Seymour</span>, &ldquo;has
been occasioned among the Foreign Missions at St. Petersburgh, by
the great differences observable in the Russian manifesto as
published in its original state, that is, as addressed to the
Russian people, and in the official French translation destined
for more general circulation in the &lsquo;St. Petersburgh
Journal.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most striking word in the original was
&ldquo;perfidiousness,&rdquo; as applied to the Sultan, an
epithet which the Government translator appears to have been
desired to omit.</p>
<p>I need not observe, that the suppression is calculated to give
an erroneous general impression of the force of that appeal which
the Emperor&rsquo;s Government has judged it necessary to make to
the prejudices&mdash;for, in this instance, I will not say
opinions&mdash;of the Russian people.&mdash;(<i>Blue Book</i>,
vol. i., p. 340.)&nbsp; This manifesto contained this
passage:&mdash;&ldquo;Having exhausted all persuasion and, with
them, every means of obtaining pacific satisfaction of our just
demands, <i>we have found it needful to advance our armies into
the Danubian Principalities</i>, <i>in order to show the Ottoman
Porte to what its obstinacy may lead</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a>&mdash;(<i>Blue Book</i>, vol. i., p.
323.)&nbsp; Of course, this never meant war&mdash;of course,
these acts were the legitimate consequences of the
Emperor&rsquo;s continued assertion of his desire for peace, and
his intentions of preserving the integrity of the Ottoman
Empire.&nbsp; This pacific course was only for the purpose of
possessing a &ldquo;material guarantee,&rdquo; and was not a
<i>casus belli</i>.&nbsp; The Western Powers were foolish enough
so to consider it; and Turkey was persuaded not to declare war
when it occurred, because the very power which Mr. <span
class="smcap">Bright</span> says was the cause why the quarrel
could not be amicably settled, had not yet given up the <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>hope of her
ability to procure peace.&nbsp; The Russians crossed the Pruth,
issued their manifesto which was in the stereotype style of all
the manifestos which, under similar circumstances, she has issued
during the last sixty years&mdash;issued to deceive Europe, and
not as indices of her conduct.&nbsp; This is the
manifesto:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Inhabitants of Moldavia and
Wallachia!&nbsp; His Majesty the Emperor of Russia, my august
master has commanded me to occupy your territory with the corps
d&rsquo;arm&eacute;e, of which he has been pleased to confide to
me the command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We arrive among you neither with plans of conquest nor
with the intention of modifying the institutions by which you are
governed, or the political situation guaranteed to you by solemn
Treaties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The provisional occupation of the Principalities which
I am directed to carry out, has no other object than that of
immediate and effectual protection in the unlooked-for and
ruinous circumstances under which the Ottoman Government,
disregarding the numerous proofs of a sincere alliance which the
Imperial Court, since the conclusion of the treaty of Adrianople,
has never ceased to give it, responds to our most just proposals
by refusals, to our most disinterested advice by the most
offensive distrust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In his longanimity, in his constant desire to maintain
peace in the East as well as in Europe, the Emperor will avoid
engaging in an offensive war against Turkey, so long as his
dignity and the interests of his Empire will permit him to do
so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the very day that he shall obtain the reparation
which is due to him, and the guarantee which he is entitled to
require for the future, his troops will withdraw within the
frontiers of Russia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inhabitants of Moldavia and Wallachia!&nbsp; I equally
execute an order of His Imperial Majesty, by declaring to you
that the presence of his troops in your country will not impose
upon you either fresh charges or contributions; that the supplies
of provisions will be paid for by our military chests at a
suitable time, and at a rate fixed beforehand in concert with
your Governments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look upon what awaits you without disquietude; betake
yourselves in security to your agricultural labours and to your
commercial speculations; obey the laws which govern you, and the
constituted authorities.&nbsp; By the faithful discharge of these
duties you will acquire the best title to the generous solicitude
and powerful protection of His Majesty the
Emperor.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Blue Book</i>, vol. i., pp.
348&ndash;9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the usual course of Russian invasions.&nbsp; She
burglariously takes possession of territory, and tells the people
that if they will be quiet and obedient, they shall receive the
&ldquo;generous solicitude&rdquo; of the imperial robber.&nbsp;
All her proclamations are similar to this in word, identical in
purpose, and observed with the same supreme indifference.&nbsp;
For the reader&rsquo;s information I will quote a passage from
the proclamation published in 1808, upon the invasion of Finland;
it will be seen that it is written in the same spirit, and was
carried out with the same fidelity:&mdash;&ldquo;It is with the
greatest regret that his Majesty the Emperor of Russia, &amp;c.,
sees himself forced to send into your country the troops under my
order. * * These motives, as well as the regard which his
Imperial Majesty owes to the safety of his own states, oblige him
to place your country <i>under his protection</i>, and to take
possession of it, in order to procure by these means <i>a
sufficient guarantee</i> in case his Swedish Majesty should
persevere in his <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>resolution not to accept the equitable conditions of
peace that have been proposed to him. * * It is his Imperial
Majesty&rsquo;s pleasure that all the affairs of the country
should have their ordinary course in conformity with your laws
and customs, which will remain in force so long as his Imperial
Majesty&rsquo;s troops shall be obliged to occupy the
country.&nbsp; The civil and military functionaries are confirmed
in their respective employments; always excepting those who may
use their authority to mislead the people, and induce them to
take measures contrary to their interests.&nbsp; All that is
necessary for the maintenance and food of the troops shall be
paid in ready money on the spot.&nbsp; All provisions shall be
paid for according to an amicable agreement between our
commissaries and those of the country.&rdquo;&nbsp; A passage
from the letter of the King of Sweden will show how these
promises are kept.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;Honour and humanity
require me to make strong representations against the innumerable
horrors and the vexations which the Russian troops have permitted
themselves in Swedish Finland.&nbsp; The blood of the innocent
victims calls for vengeance upon those who authorised such
cruelties. * * * Can it be a crime in my Finnish subjects not to
have wished to let themselves be seduced by promises which are as
fallacious as the principles on which they are founded are
erroneous!&nbsp; Is it worthy of a Sovereign to make it in them a
crime?&nbsp; I conjure your Imperial Majesty to put an end to the
calamities and the horrors of a war which ought to call down on
your person and your empire the malediction of Divine
Providence.&rdquo; <a name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a>&nbsp; We know that Finnish protection
ended in Incorporation, and, but for the glorious bravery of the
Turks at Oltenitza, Citate, and Silistria, and the interference
of the Allies, such would, without doubt, have been the fate of
the Principalities.&nbsp; The same tactics were employed; similar
oppressions exercised; identical courses pursued.&nbsp; Russia
ordered the taxes to be paid to her general; required obedience
from the Hospadas and service from the people; forbade their
communicating with the Sultan, their lawful ruler.&nbsp; This
general order will shew what kind of protection she exercised:
&ldquo;Ordered 1st.&nbsp; That all men from the age of eighteen
to forty years, married or unmarried, and whatever their
profession may be, are required by the generals, colonels, and
commanders of corps to do service for the Russian army.&nbsp;
2.&nbsp; That horses, waggons, oxen, and other beasts of burden,
may be required for the same service.&nbsp; And, 3.&nbsp; That
all boats, barks, or floats now on the Danube, are seized for the
present moment for the service of the Russian army.&nbsp; This
decree is applicable to all Wallachian subjects.&nbsp; Those who
attempt to evade its execution shall <i>be tried by court
martial</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such is Russian protection.</p>
<p>We now reach the period of the famous Vienna note, which, says
Mr. <span class="smcap">Bright</span>, &ldquo;Russia accepted at
once&mdash;accepted it, I believe, by telegraph, even before the
precise words of it had been received in St. Petersburgh.&nbsp;
Everybody thought the question now settled.&nbsp; A Cabinet
Minister told me we should never hear another word about it;
&lsquo;the whole thing is at an end,&rsquo; he said, and so it
appeared for a moment.&nbsp; But the Turk refused the note which
had been drawn up by his own arbitrators, and which Russia had
accepted.&rdquo;&nbsp; No one will be surprised at the Turk
rejecting this note, when he reads the original words of the note
and compares them with the suggested amendments of the Ottoman
Government:</p>
<h3><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Words
of the Original Note.</h3>
<p>If the Emperors of Russia have at all times evinced their
active solicitude for <i>the maintenance of the immunities and
privileges of the orthodox Greek Church in the Ottoman
Empire</i>, <i>the Sultans have never refused again to confirm
them</i> by solemn acts testifying their ancient and constant
benevolence towards their Christian subjects.</p>
<p>His Majesty the Sultan will remain faithful <i>to the letter
and to the spirit of the Treaties of Kainardji and
Adrianople</i>, <i>relative to the protection of the Christian
religion</i>, * * * and moreover in a spirit of exalted equity,
to cause the Greek rite to share in the advantages <i>granted to
the other Christian rites by Convention or special
arrangement</i>.</p>
<h3>Amended Note.</h3>
<p>If the Emperors of Russia have at all times evinced their
active solicitude for <i>the religion and orthodox Greek
Church</i>, <i>the Sultans have never ceased to provide for the
maintenance of the privileges and immunities which at different
times they have spontaneously granted to that religion and to
that Church in the Ottoman Empire</i>, <i>and to confirm
them</i>.</p>
<p>His Majesty the Sultan will remain faithful <i>to the
stipulations of the Treaty of Kainardji</i>, <i>confirmed by that
of Adrianople relative to the protection by the Sublime Porte of
the Christian religion</i>, <i>and he is moreover charged to make
known</i>, * * * and moreover in a spirit of exalted equity, to
cause the Greek rite to share in the advantages <i>granted</i>,
<i>or which might be granted</i>, <i>to the other Christian
Communities</i>, <i>Ottoman subjects</i>.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The intellect which cannot see the difference&mdash;the
essential difference&mdash;of these words must, in some way or
other, be very far from being healthy.&nbsp; The three great
Powers acknowledged the justice of the alterations, and M. <span
class="smcap">Drouyn de Lhuys</span>, though he &ldquo;regrets
the introduction of any modifications into the Vienna note,
certainly considers them to be for the
better.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Blue Book</i>, vol. ii., p. 85.)&nbsp;
These modifications the Emperor of Russia refused to accept; and
though France and England, still desirous of peace, advised the
Turks not to declare war against Russia, is it surprising that
she did?&nbsp; The wonder is that she suffered her hands to be
tied so long, considering that the enemy was in her territories
and exercising all the powers of military government over her
subjects.&nbsp; Because Turkey refused the first note, and Russia
the amended one, Mr. <span class="smcap">Bright</span> has the
audacity to tell us that &ldquo;the Turks should have been
prevented from going to war, <i>or should have been allowed to go
to war on their own risk</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; In no fit of temporary
excitement did the Turks adopt this last resort of nations.&nbsp;
She summoned a council of her wisest, her gravest, and her best,
and then, after mature deliberation, issued the declaration of
war.&nbsp; &ldquo;The decisions were unanimous.&nbsp; The meeting
consisted of more than a hundred persons.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Blue
Book</i>, vol. ii., p. 130.)</p>
<p>Such is the history of that contest which is at present waging
between England, France, Turkey, and Russia.&nbsp; I have
endeavoured to state the whole question without prejudice or
passion.&nbsp; Believing thoroughly in the justice of the war, I
have sought to master all its bearings, and so to state the
result that reason should be the only adjudicator appealed
to.&nbsp; I have expressed few opinions of my own, preferring to
quote from official documents, so that the reader might have the
authoritative documents in his possession, and be thus enabled to
compare them with the garbled extracts which have been made from
these very interesting Blue Books on the Holy Places.&nbsp; The
whole development of the question reveals Russia at her old game;
a game she has unceasingly played since the time of Peter I.; a
game by which she has more than doubled her original empire; a
game which has brought to her unholy rule Poland, Finland, the
Crimea, Georgia, Bessarabia, and so many other provinces which
she has filched from her neighbours.&nbsp; &ldquo;For one hundred
and sixty years Russia <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>has steadily kept in view the objects
of ambition in the East first contemplated by Peter I., and
bequeathed by him to his successors.&nbsp; These were, to raise
Russia upon the ruins of Turkey&mdash;to obtain exclusive
possession of the Caspian and Black Sea, with the Bosphorus and
the Dardanelles&mdash;to extend her dominions beyond the
Caucasus&mdash;to domineer in Persia with a view to open the road
to India; and history perhaps furnishes no other example of equal
pertinacity in prosecuting, <i>per fas et nefas</i>, a
predetermined course of aggrandisement.&nbsp; Her crown has
frequently been transferred, by open violence or secret crime,
from one head or one family to another, but each successive
sovereign, with hardly an exception, has made some progress
towards the attainment of these objects, and she continues to
prosecute them with unabated avidity.&rdquo; <a
name="citation16a"></a><a href="#footnote16a"
class="citation">[16a]</a>&nbsp; Yet, with these facts before his
eyes, and strengthening himself with a quotation from Lord <span
class="smcap">Palmerston</span>, who says just what suits his
purpose at the moment, Mr. <span class="smcap">Bright</span>
declares that &ldquo;The danger of the Russian power was a
phantom.&rdquo;&nbsp; Any one might suppose from such statements
that men read history with their understandings warped by some
strange hallucination which prevented them from profitting by its
lessons.&nbsp; Russian power of aggression a phantom!&nbsp; Why
her whole modern history is one continued record of aggressions
committed on foreign states, and she is now as desirous as ever
of increasing her dominions.&nbsp; The late Emperor was scarcely
cold before his son, <span class="smcap">Alexander</span> II.,
asked &ldquo;Providence which has selected us for so high a
calling to be our guide and protector, that we may maintain
Russia on the highest standard of power and glory, and in our
person accomplish the incessant wishes and aims of Peter, of
Catherine, of Alexander, and of our father.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of
these incessant wishes and aims is the possession of
Constantinople, the Bosphorous, and the Dardanelles.</p>
<p>To show the nature of the Russian policy and her unvarying
method of carrying it out, I select a few instances of her
aggressions.&nbsp; A goodly volume might be filled with such
violations of all rights, natural and divine:&mdash;From Sweden
she gained Finland in 1809; the lion&rsquo;s share of Poland fell
to her after the three fatal partitions of 1772, 1793, and 1795,
and Warsaw was added in 1815; from Persia she wrung Georgia, in
1814; and Turkey lost the Crimea in 1784, and Bessarabia in
1812.&nbsp; I now give an abstract of the extent of her
acquisitions, which proves that within the last sixty-four years
she has acquired territories equal in extent and importance to
the whole empire she had in Europe before that time.&nbsp; From
Sweden she has stolen more than what now remains of that kingdom;
what she won from Poland nearly equals the whole Austrian empire;
from Turkey in Europe, her gain is greater than the Prussian
dominions, exclusive of the Rhenish Provinces; and from Turkey in
Asia it is nearly equal to the whole of the smaller states of
Germany.&nbsp; Persia has been plundered of dominions equal to
England; and from Tartary she has filched possessions not
inferior to that of Turkey in Europe, Greece, Italy, and Spain.
<a name="citation16b"></a><a href="#footnote16b"
class="citation">[16b]</a>&nbsp; Surely this is a sufficient
evidence of her aggressive policy, and also sufficient to show
that her power is not a mere phantom.</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bright</span> can never have read
Russian history, or he would scarcely have penned the sentence
that we are at war for &ldquo;the maintenance <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>of the most
immoral and filthy of all despotisms over one of the fairest
portions of the earth which it has desolated, and over a
population it has degraded, but has not been able to
destroy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bad as Turkish despotism has been, it must
pale its ineffectual fires before that of Russia; the horrors
committed by Peter and Catherine, the religious persecutions of
Nicholas, the fate of the Minsk nuns, the massacre of thousands
of unopposing and helpless victims which everywhere defiles her
annals.&nbsp; Of her horrible crimes, too hideous to be named; of
her serf population, of her degraded priesthood guilty of every
enormity of which human nature is capable, I need not here
enlarge.&nbsp; From the days when Peter had his own son
assassinated, butchered his people, massacred the Strelitzes, and
at a banquet which he gave to the Prussian Ambassador, Prinz, had
twenty of these unfortunate men brought into the room and there
beheaded; and as each head fell he quaffed a bumper, desiring his
guest to do the same; from the days when her Generals <span
class="smcap">Potemkin</span> and <span
class="smcap">Suvaroff</span>, at the command of Catherine,
slaughtered in the Crimea &ldquo;thirty thousand Tartars of
either sex and every age, in cold blood,&rdquo; down to the
Sinope horrors of last year, her policy, her spirit, her objects
and aims have undergone no change.&nbsp; And it is sad quibbling
to say, as it has recently been said by an advocate of the Peace
Society, that the Secret Correspondence contains not a single
word threatening, or intimating a threat, of active aggression on
the part of Russia against the &ldquo;sick man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Russia never <i>talks</i> of active aggression, but always of
peace, and is always aggrandising.&nbsp; Her course is well drawn
by her own historian <span class="smcap">Karamsin</span>, and he
says, &ldquo;The object and character of our military policy has
invariably been, <i>to seek to be at peace with everybody</i>,
<i>and to make conquests without war</i>; <i>always keeping
ourselves on the defensive</i>, <i>placing no faith on the
friendship of those whose interests do not accord with our
own</i>, <i>and losing no opportunity of injuring</i>, <i>without
ostensibly breaking our treaties with them</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such
is the moral code of a nation whose apologists are not a few in
free and moral England!</p>
<p>The Emperor tells Europe, and Mr. <span
class="smcap">Bright</span> supports him, that &ldquo;England and
France have sided with the enemies of Christianity against Russia
combating for the Orthodox Faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now if the Turks
have justice on their side, and I trust sufficient evidence has
been advanced to prove they have, how can we be at war against
Christianity in supporting them?&nbsp; Is not justice the very
basis of all religion?&nbsp; It is the basis and only true
ground-work of mercy itself, without which it is mere idleness to
talk of religion.&nbsp; But the Czar and Mr. <span
class="smcap">Bright</span> have availed themselves of the simply
fact that the Russians <i>profess</i> Christianity, and that the
Turks are Mahommedans, to inform the world that we are fighting
the battle of the infidel against the faithful.&nbsp; We will not
pause here to show what a Christianity this is which the Emperor
proclaims as the only one orthodox faith, and for the propagation
and establishment of which Russia has been selected by Divine
Providence.&nbsp; It is not a religious war at all.&nbsp; It is
simply a political war.&nbsp; But even if it were a religious
war&mdash;by taking whose side in this quarrel should we be best
helping the cause of religion?&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says a
member of the Prussian Senate, &ldquo;the <i>wrong</i> that
Russia was doing was not made <i>right</i> by the religious
grounds that she put forward as a pretence for her policy.&nbsp;
It was true the question had a religious bearing; the whole earth
was eventually to be converted to Christianity; but this
providential future development of the world will not authorise
any one <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>secular power to constitute itself the executioner of
the Divine will, and it could not be in conformity therewith when
a great power sought to crush a weaker by a breach of treaty and
force of arms.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Earl of <span
class="smcap">Shaftesbury</span>, whose religious character none
will doubt, and whose devotion to the cause of Religious Freedom
has won for him a high place in the annals of England, has met
this question in its true bearing.&nbsp; In his masterly speech
in the House of Lords on the Turkish difficulty he said,
&ldquo;As to the alliance with Turkey, there is a wide difference
between an alliance with any power, heathen though it may be, to
maintain the cause of justice and order against the aggressions
of professing Christians, and an alliance of which the result
would be the development and aggrandisement of that power.&nbsp;
Justice, Order, and Right are such things in the eyes of God that
they must be respected * * It could be shown that, with the
Turks, there were facilities for the promotion of civilization
and the improvement of mankind, which were denied to the
Christians within the territory of Russia, and which would be
still more denied them if the Emperor were enabled to extend his
dominions over the East.&nbsp; There are more than forty towns
and villages in Turkey in which there are distinct congregations
of Protestant seceders from the Greek Church. * * During the last
twenty years the diffusion of the Bible in Turkey had been almost
incredible; whereas not even a single copy had been printed in
Russia&mdash;the language of the people since 1823, and the
circulation of it is forbidden under the severest
penalties.&nbsp; With a population of 2,000,000 of Jews in his
dominions, the Emperor will not permit a single copy of the
Scriptures in Hebrew to pass the frontiers.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Earl
of <span class="smcap">Shaftesbury</span> also read the following
Imperial Firman, which shows the liberality of the Sultan in
strong contrast to the persecuting spirit of the Czar:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Firman</span>.&mdash;To
my Vizier, Mahmoud Pasha, Prefect of Police in
Constantinople.&nbsp; When this sublime and august mandate
reaches you, let it be known that hitherto those of my Christian
subjects who have embraced the Protestant faith have suffered
much inconvenience and distress.&nbsp; But, in necessary
accordance with my Imperial compassion, which is the support of
all, and which is manifested to all classes of my subjects, it is
contrary to my Imperial pleasure that any one class of them
should be exposed to suffering.&nbsp; As, therefore, by reason of
their faith, the above-mentioned are already a separate
community, it is my Royal compassionate will that, for
facilitating the conducting of their affairs, and that they may
obtain ease, and quiet, and safety, a faithful and trustworthy
person from among themselves, and by their own selection, shall
be appointed, with the title of <i>Agent for the Protestants</i>,
and that he should be in relations with the Prefecture of the
Police.&nbsp; You will not permit anything to be required of them
in the name of fee, or other pretence, for marriage licences or
registration.&nbsp; You will see to it, that, like the other
communities of the empire, in all their affairs, such as
procuring cemeteries and places of worship, they should have
every facility and every needful assistance.&nbsp; You will not
permit that any of the other communities shall in any way
interfere with their edifices, or with their worldly matters or
concerns, or, in short, with any of their affairs, either secular
or religious, that thus they may be free to exercise the usages
of their faith.&nbsp; And it is enjoined upon you not to allow
them to be molested an iota in these particulars, or in any
others; and that all attention and perseverance be put in
requisition to maintain them in quiet and security.&nbsp; And, in
case of necessity, they shall be free <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>to make representations regarding
their affairs, through their agent, to the Sublime
Porte.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In this,&rdquo; continued the Earl, &ldquo;I believe is
to be found the whole secret of the movement on the part of the
Emperor of Russia.&nbsp; He saw that it would give to these Greek
Christians a status, a recognized independence, and emancipated
them from the influence of Russia; he saw that the circulation of
the Scriptures was giving rise to those aspirations after
liberty, which religious freedom must inevitably be followed by,
and his own dominions were contiguous to those in which this
religious freedom was tolerated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The true nature of Russia&rsquo;s religious movement is well
pointed out by Lord <span class="smcap">Stratford</span> de <span
class="smcap">Redcliffe</span>.&nbsp; He is giving the Earl of
<span class="smcap">Clarendon</span> a summary of the state of
the question when he arrived at Constantinople, and of the
difficulties which lie in the way of its settlement.&nbsp; As
respects arriving at an amicable adjustment of the differences he
says, &ldquo;The prospect in this direction would be more
promising if Russia were to shew signs of being disposed to act
on Christian rather than on sectarian principles.&nbsp; But it
appears that the protection which her Government wish to exercise
with so little control or limitation, is of a strictly exclusive
character; and it has reached me, from more quarters than one,
that, among the motives for increasing their influence in this
country, is the desire of repressing Protestantism wherever it
appears.&rdquo;&mdash;(<i>Blue Book</i>, vol. i., p. 29.)</p>
<p>England, France, and Turkey have striven to divest this
quarrel of any character of Islamism versus Christianity, and to
rest it on the broad basis of justice and right.&nbsp; The
Emperor has sought to make it a second crusade, and has used
every influence in his power as head of the Church to excite the
fanaticism, sectarian zeal, and religious bigotry of his
people.&nbsp; In doing so he has shown himself capable of calling
into action the most terrible of all weapons, so that therewith
he can achieve his end.&nbsp; It was little to have been expected
that a member of the most peaceful and tolerant of Christian
communities should have aided him in this dreadful and iniquitous
course.&nbsp; It is one more fatal illustration of how far men
will allow themselves to be carried when once they abandon the
strict path of reason, and allow feeling and prejudice to warp
their otherwise sound judgment.</p>
<p>Before I leave this question of the &ldquo;secret
correspondence,&rdquo; I will quote a passage from Sir G. H.
<span class="smcap">Seymour</span>, which I commend to the most
careful consideration of those who think that Russia was desirous
of keeping on terms of amity and justice with the Porte.&nbsp;
The words are,&mdash;&ldquo;The sovereign who insists with much
pertinacity upon the impending fall of a neighbouring state, must
have settled in his own mind that the hour, if not <i>of</i> its
dissolution, yet <i>for</i> its dissolution, is at
hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; To my mind, it is clear in what manner <span
class="smcap">Nicholas</span> had made up his mind respecting
this dissolution; and it was no fault of his if the hour is not
at hand.</p>
<p>A few words more.&nbsp; One course pursued by the Peace
Society is very strange.&nbsp; While apologising for and
defending Russia, most of its public speakers and lecturers
denounce France and Austria.&nbsp; I shall not defend either of
these Powers.&nbsp; Those who oppose Russia on the same grounds
which I do, will be slow to do <i>that</i>.&nbsp; But how can
these men, opposing the present war, reconcile it to their
consciences to seek to embroil us with two other powers?&nbsp; Is
it that they only deprecate war when waged against a favourite
despot, and are reckless as to fanning the flames when others are
concerned?&nbsp; Whatever may be their reasons, it is still a
strange <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>problem&mdash;one which these gentlemen may find some
difficulty in solving.&nbsp; Now that we are at war, let us hope
that we shall not again sheath the sword until we have secured
peace on such a firm and secure basis that it shall not be in the
power of future squabblers about a key, a stone, or a cupola, on
the one hand&mdash;nor of aggrandising and unscrupulous ambition
on the other&mdash;to overthrow the peace of nations, to threaten
the existence and liberties of weaker states, to interrupt the
commerce of the world, and to retard the civilization of the
race.&nbsp; For many years Russia has been the incubus of
Europe.&nbsp; She has laid her cold grasp upon all its
aspirations, and sent out her serried legions to quench in blood
the budding life and reviving freedom of many states.&nbsp; Her
name has been a terror&mdash;her presence a curse; her
instruments are fraud, rapine, and destruction; her rule is based
upon ignorance, superstition and slavery; and, brutal herself,
she knows of only one system of governing men&mdash;a system
which depends on chains, the knout, Siberia, and death!&nbsp; The
man who lauds such a system is hardly fit to speak the tongue
which Shakspere spoke; and, as he is so much of a Russian
subject, it is a pity that his citizenship is not complete, and
that he were a dweller beneath her mild rule&mdash;a sojourner
beneath her clement skies.&nbsp; For him our forefathers have
lived, fought, and achieved freedom in vain.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Who would not blush, if such a man there
be?<br />
Who would not weep, if Atticus were he?&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
